📌 About the Project

This project is a Diabetes Prediction System that uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes.

It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical attributes such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, age, pregnancies, and diabetes pedigree function.

The project includes:

🧠 Model Training – Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Learning models are trained and evaluated.

💻 Desktop App (Tkinter GUI) – Enter patient details and get predictions instantly.

🌐 Web App (Streamlit) – A modern, interactive browser-based application with confidence scores and clean UI.

The goal is to provide a simple, data-driven tool for the early detection of diabetes risk, useful for both individuals and healthcare professionals.
